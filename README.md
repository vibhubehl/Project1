# Uvic-Timetable-builder

This project implements a timetable builder for Uvic. The projected is implemented in Python. It uses webscraping to find Uvic's course information. It asks users for courses they want to take and a few simple questions, related to their course preferences. Then based on their answers it ranks all possible schedules and presents them the best suitable timetable.
